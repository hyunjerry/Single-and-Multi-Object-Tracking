### Part 1: Single Object Tracking with a Bayesian Recursive Filter  

We have implemented both **an alpha-beta filter** and **a Kalman filter** to generate a 2D track of the vehicle based on the given 2D observations from [object_to_track.json](object_to_track.json).  

The results generated by different methods are named with different suffixes. The data ([part_1_object_tracking.json](part_1_object_tracking.json)) and the video [part_1_demo.mp4](part_1_demo.mp4)) submitted for the final test were generated by the Kalman filter.  

We have got 20/20 from the autograder.  

### Part 2: Multi-Object Tracking and Data Association  

Given the bounding boxes of multiple objects detected in the video, we are required to track them by assigning a unique ID to each object as long as they are detected and recorded in [frame_dict.json](frame_dict.json). We have implemented **the Hungarian algorithm** manually to match objects across frames, optimizing for minimal discrepancies in predictions and detections.  

We have got 20/20 from the autograder.
